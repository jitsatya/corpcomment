## Improving project folder structure

- We can improve the project folder structure by Categorizing each folder by the functional properties, like we can categorize everything related to feedback to a new folder named feedback.
- We can put all the layout related files in the layout folder to get a bigger picture into the layout easily
- If there are files that can not go into any folder they can stay in the root of the components
