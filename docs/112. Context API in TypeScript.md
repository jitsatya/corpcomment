## What context to create?

We can create context for the states that are controlling the application. we move the context state to a dedicated component. Move every operation related to that state to the context provider.

Name of the context providers are usually STATEContextProvide

For better organizational purposes, we should create a new folder named contexts for all the context providers of the app.

Wrap the provider to only the components that need access to the provider, don't wrap entire app with the provider
