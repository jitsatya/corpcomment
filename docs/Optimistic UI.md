## Persisting Data

There are two ways to persist data, one is locally and the other is using network request to send the data to a backend server.

For posting data to the server using the fetch api we have to provide the url and an object which contains the request properties like method, body, headers etc.

## Optimistic UI

In optimistic UI update, we update the ui instantly while being optimistic about the network request to the server to be successful.
